    <string>If you love somebody
     Better tell them why they're here 'cause
     They just may run away from you
     You'll never know what went well
     Then again it just depends on
     How long of time is left for you
     I've had the highest mountains
     I've had the deepest rivers
     You can have it all but not til you move it
     Now take it in but don't look down
     'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     Waiting on this for a while now
     Paying my dues to the dirt
     I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
     Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
     Take it with me if I can
     Been dreaming of this since a child
     I'm on top of the world
     I've tried to cut these corners
     Try to take the easy way out
     I kept on falling short of something
     I coulda gave up then but
     Then again I couldn't have 'cause
     I've traveled all this way for something
     Now take it in but don't look down
     'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     Waiting on this for a while now
     Paying my dues to the dirt
     I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
     Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
     Take it with me if I can
     Been dreaming of this since a child
     I'm on top of the world
     'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     Waiting on this for a while now
     Paying my dues to the dirt
     I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
     Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
     Take it with me if I can
     Been dreaming of this since a child
     And I know it's hard when you're falling down
     And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
     Get up now, get up, get up now
     And I know it's hard when you're falling down
     And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
     Get up now, get up, get up now
     'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     I'm on top of the world, 'ey
     Waiting on this for a while now
     Paying my dues to the dirt
     I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
