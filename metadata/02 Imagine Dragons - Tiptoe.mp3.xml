    <string>In the morning light, let my roots take flight
     Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
     They don't see me come, who can blame them?
     They never seem to catch my eye but I've never wondered why
     I won't fall asleep, I won't fall asleep
     Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
     Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
     From your slanted view, see the morning dew
     Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
     They won't see me run, who can blame them?
     They never look to see me fly, so, I never had to lie
     I won't fall asleep, I won't fall asleep
     Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
     Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
     Nobody else
     Nobody else
     Nobody else can take me higher
     Nobody else can take me higher
     Nobody else can take me higher
     Nobody else
     Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
     Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
     Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
