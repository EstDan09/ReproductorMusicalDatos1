    <string>So, this is what you meant when you said that you were spent?
     And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
     Right to the top, don't hold back
     Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check
     I don't ever wanna let you down
     I don't ever wanna leave this town
     'Cause after all
     This city never sleeps at night
     It's time to begin, isn't it?
     I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
     I'm just the same as I was
     Now, don't you understand
     That I'm never changing who I am?
     So, this is where you fell, and I am left to sell?
     The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
     Right to the top, don't look back
     Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
     I don't ever wanna let you down
     I don't ever wanna leave this town
     'Cause after all
     This city never sleeps at night
     It's time to begin, isn't it?
     I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
     I'm just the same as I was
     Now, don't you understand
     That I'm never changing who I am?
     It's time to begin, isn't it?
     I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
     I'm just the same as I was
     Now, don't you understand
     That I'm never changing who I am?
     This road never looked so lonely
     This house doesn't burn down slowly
     To ashes, to ashes
     It's time to begin, isn't it?
     I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
     I'm just the same as I was
     Now, don't you understand
     That I'm never changing who I am?
     It's time to begin, isn't it?
     I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
     I'm just the same as I was
     Don't you understand
     That I'm never changing who I am?</string>
