    <string>When the days are cold
     And the cards all fold
     And the saints we see are all made of gold
     When your dreams all fail
     And the ones we hail
     Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
     I wanna hide the truth
     I wanna shelter you
     But with the beast inside
     There's nowhere we can hide
     No matter what we breed
     We still are made of greed
     This is my kingdom come
     This is my kingdom come
     When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide
     Don't get too close, it's dark inside
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide
     At the curtain's call
     It's the last of all
     When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
     So they dug your grave
     And the masquerade
     Will come calling out at the mess you've made
     Don't wanna let you down
     But I am hell-bound
     Though this is all for you
     Don't wanna hide the truth
     No matter what we breed
     We still are made of greed
     This is my kingdom come
     This is my kingdom come
     When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide
     Don't get too close, it's dark inside
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide
     They say it's what you make
     I say it's up to fate
     It's woven in my soul
     I need to let you go
     Your eyes, they shine so bright
     I wanna save that light
     I can't escape this now
     Unless you show me how
     When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide
     Don't get too close, it's dark inside
     It's where my demons hide
     It's where my demons hide</string>
