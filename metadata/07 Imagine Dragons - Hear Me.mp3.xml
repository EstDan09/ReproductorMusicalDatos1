    <string>Try to hear my voice
     You can leave, now it's your choice
     Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
     Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back
     I said it before, I won't say it again
     Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
     Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
     Can nobody hear me?
     I've got a lot that's on my mind
     I cannot breathe
     Can you hear it, too?
     You kiss and you kiss
     And you love and you love
     You've got a history list and the rest is above
     And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
     From the floor to the floor
     And the sky to the sky
     You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
     And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
     I said it before, I won't say it again
     Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
     Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right
     Can nobody hear me?
     I've got a lot that's on my mind
     I cannot breathe
     Can you hear it, too?
     Leave your shoes at the door, baby
     I am all you adore, lately
     Come with me and we will run away
     Can nobody hear me?
     I've got a lot that's on my mind
     I cannot breathe
     Can you hear it, too?
     Can nobody hear me?
     I've got a lot that's on my mind
     I cannot breathe
     Can you hear it, too?</string>
