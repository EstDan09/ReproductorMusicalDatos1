    <string>I'm sorry, mother I'm sorry, I let you down
     Well, these days I'm fine
     No these days I tend to lie
     I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
     Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man
     I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down
     Well, these days you're fine
     No these days you tend to lie
     You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
     Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man
     Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
     It's hard, believe me I've tried
     But I keep coming up short
     I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down
     Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
     Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
     You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"
     Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
     It's hard, believe me I've tried
     Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
     It's hard, believe me I've tried
     But the rain won't fall for the both of us
     The sun won't shine on the both of us
     Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way
     Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
     It's hard, believe me I've tried
     But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
     And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
     And I keep coming up short</string>
